# CLI Adventure RPG

**Author**: Jack Skates

## Project Overview
CLI Adventure RPG is a text-based role-playing game (RPG) built in C++. Players explore a grid-based map, encounter enemies, collect items, and complete quests. The game includes:

- **Turn-based combat system**
- **Inventory management**
- **Player progression through leveling and stat upgrades**
- **Storyline with a main quest and optional side quests**

### Focus
This project aims to master C++ fundamentals, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data structures (e.g., vectors, arrays)
- Algorithms for combat, map generation, and progression
- File I/O for optional save/load functionality

---

## Tools and Technologies

### Programming Language
- C++ (Standard 17 or higher recommended)

### Development Environment
- **VS Code** with Code Runner extension
- **clang++** compiler for C++

### Libraries
- Standard Template Library (STL) for vectors, strings, etc.
- Optional: **ncurses** for advanced CLI formatting (if time permits)

### Version Control
- **Git** and **GitHub** for source control

### Documentation
- Markdown for README and project documentation

---

## Project Goals

### Core Mechanics
- Grid-based exploration with random events
- Turn-based combat system
- Player leveling and stat progression

### Additional Features
- Inventory management with collectible items
- Main quest and optional side quests
- Save/load system for replayability (optional)

### Presentation
- Polished CLI experience with clear menus and feedback
- ASCII art for visual enhancement (if time permits)

## Sprint Plan

### **Sprint 1: Week 1 (Core Development)**

#### Focus: Build the core game mechanics and systems.

| Day | Task                                                                                  |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Set up project structure in C++. Implement the `Player` and `Map` classes. Build a basic game loop with input handling. |
| 2   | Implement the turn-based combat system. Add basic enemy types and random encounters.  |
| 3   | Create the inventory system. Add basic items (e.g., healing potions, weapons).        |
| 4   | Introduce leveling and stat progression for the player.                              |
| 5   | Add text-based feedback for actions and outcomes.                                    |

### **Sprint 2: Week 2 (Polish and Advanced Features)**

#### Focus: Add narrative, polish, and optional features.

| Day | Task                                                                                  |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Add a main quest and optional side quests with storylines. Implement quest tracking and player progression. |
| 2   | Add a challenging boss battle.                                                       |
| 3   | Implement optional save/load functionality using file I/O.                           |
| 4   | Enhance user experience with a help menu and ASCII art.                              |
| 5   | Final testing, bug fixes, and documentation.                                         |

## Timeline

| Week | Milestones                                                                                      |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Game loop, player mechanics, map exploration, combat system, and inventory management          |
| 2    | Quests, boss battle, save/load system, UI enhancements, testing, and final documentation        |

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk            | Mitigation                                                                         |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scope Creep      | Keep the feature set minimal and focus on polishing core mechanics.               |
| Learning Curve   | Allocate time to research and troubleshoot issues in C++.                         |
| Time Constraints | Prioritize essential features and mark optional features clearly.                 |
